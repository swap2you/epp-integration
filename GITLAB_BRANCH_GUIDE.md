# GitLab Branch Management & Check-in Guide

## Creating Feature Branches

### 1. Create and Switch to New Branch
```powershell
# Create feature branch for new work
git checkout -b feature/payment-enhancements

# Or create bugfix branch
git checkout -b bugfix/validation-errors

# Or create hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-security-patch
```

### 2. Work on Your Changes
```powershell
# Check what files have changed
git status

# View your changes
git diff

# Stage specific files
git add src/main/java/com/example/PaymentService.java

# Or stage everything
git add .
```

### 3. Commit Your Changes
```powershell
# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add payment retry logic with exponential backoff"

# Or commit with detailed message
git commit -m "feat: enhance payment validation

- Add input sanitization for all payment fields
- Implement business rule validation
- Add comprehensive error messages
- Update unit tests for new validation logic"
```

### 4. Push Branch to GitLab
```powershell
# Push new branch to GitLab
git push -u origin feature/payment-enhancements

# For subsequent pushes to same branch
git push
```

## GitLab Merge Request Process

### 1. Create Merge Request
1. Go to your GitLab repository
2. Click "Create merge request" button
3. Select source branch (your feature branch) â†’ target branch (main)
4. Add description and assign reviewers
5. Click "Create merge request"

### 2. Merge Request Best Practices
- **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
- **Description**: Explain what changes were made and why
- **Assign**: Add team members for code review
- **Labels**: Use appropriate labels (feature, bugfix, documentation)
- **Milestone**: Link to project milestone if applicable

## Daily GitLab Workflow

### Morning Routine
```powershell
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Create new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-task-name

# Start working on your changes...
```

### Evening Check-in
```powershell
# Check what you've changed
git status
git diff

# Stage and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "wip: progress on payment integration"

# Push to remote branch
git push origin feature/new-task-name
```

## Managing Multiple Branches

### Switch Between Branches
```powershell
# List all branches
git branch -a

# Switch to existing branch
git checkout feature/other-feature

# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Create branch from specific commit
git checkout -b hotfix/urgent-fix abc1234
```

### Keep Branch Updated
```powershell
# While on your feature branch
git checkout feature/your-branch

# Fetch latest main changes
git fetch origin main

# Merge main into your branch
git merge origin/main

# Or rebase your branch on main (cleaner history)
git rebase origin/main
```

## Conflict Resolution

### When Merge Conflicts Occur
```powershell
# Pull latest changes and see conflicts
git pull origin main

# View conflicted files
git status

# Edit files to resolve conflicts manually
# Look for <<<<<<< HEAD, =======, >>>>>>> markers

# After resolving conflicts, stage files
git add conflicted-file.java

# Complete the merge
git commit -m "resolve merge conflicts with main"
```

## Release Management

### Creating Release Branch
```powershell
# Create release branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0

# Make final adjustments
# Update version numbers, documentation

# Commit release preparations
git commit -m "prepare release v1.2.0"

# Push release branch
git push -u origin release/v1.2.0
```

### Tagging Releases
```powershell
# Create annotated tag
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release version 1.2.0 - Enhanced payment processing"

# Push tags to GitLab
git push origin v1.2.0

# Or push all tags
git push origin --tags
```

## GitLab CI/CD Integration

### Pipeline Triggers
```powershell
# Push to trigger pipeline
git push origin feature/your-branch

# Create merge request to trigger merge pipeline
# Tag commit to trigger release pipeline
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Patch release"
git push origin v1.0.1
```

### Pipeline Status
- Check pipeline status in GitLab UI
- View job logs for failed builds
- Retry failed jobs if needed

## Emergency Procedures

### Rollback Changes
```powershell
# Rollback last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Rollback and discard changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Rollback specific file
git checkout HEAD -- filename.java
```

### Hotfix Process
```powershell
# Create hotfix from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue

# Make urgent fix
git add .
git commit -m "hotfix: resolve critical security vulnerability"

# Push hotfix
git push -u origin hotfix/critical-issue

# Create urgent merge request to main
```

## Branch Cleanup

### After Merge Request is Accepted
```powershell
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Pull merged changes
git pull origin main

# Delete local feature branch
git branch -d feature/completed-feature

# Delete remote branch (if not auto-deleted)
git push origin --delete feature/completed-feature
```

### Cleanup Old Branches
```powershell
# List all branches
git branch -a

# Delete multiple local branches
git branch -D branch1 branch2 branch3

# Prune remote tracking branches
git remote prune origin
```

## GitLab Project Settings

### Repository Settings
1. **Branch Protection**: Protect main branch from direct pushes
2. **Merge Request Settings**: Require approvals, remove source branch after merge
3. **CI/CD Variables**: Set environment-specific variables
4. **Deploy Keys**: Add SSH keys for deployment servers

### Useful GitLab Features
- **Issues**: Track bugs and features
- **Wiki**: Project documentation
- **Snippets**: Code snippets and utilities
- **Container Registry**: Docker images
- **Packages**: Maven artifacts
