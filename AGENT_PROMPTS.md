## 💡 Tips for Better Prompts

### Be Specific
❌ "Fix my code"
✅ "Fix validation errors in PaymentService.java and ensure all edge cases are handled"

### Include Context
❌ "Add tests"
✅ "Add unit tests for the payment validation logic covering success, failure, and edge cases"

### Specify Scope
❌ "Update documentation"
✅ "Update README.md with current API endpoints, environment setup, and deployment instructions"

### Request Verification
```
Fix the database connection issues and verify the solution works
```

```
Refactor the service layer and ensure all existing tests still pass
